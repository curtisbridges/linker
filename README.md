# Linker (working title)

The goal of this project is to have a URL shortener service / bookmarking site for my personal use.

I want the following features:
- Implemented with node.js / express.js / mongodb
- Basic link CRUD
- User CRUD
- Full auth using JWT tokens
- Statistics for articles per site, referrer, etc.
- AWS hosting
- Docker deployable
- https by default
- [maybe] Readability support
- [maybe] Sharing support
- [maybe] Highlighting support
